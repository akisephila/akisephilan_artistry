		<h2>Hunger (Famine)</h2>
		<p>
		Her name was Mara Goldlock and she was singlehandedly the richest person on the entirety of planet Earth.<br>
		She had many names. Famine, Greed, Exploitation, Starvation. In another time, she was known as the Harsh Marauder. Her true name was Hunger. Her children were numerous throughout the universe, in many shapes and forms. 
		She sniffed the air. One of them, an ancient hulking mass of flesh, defied her. She would have to deal with it at some point.
		<br><br>
		Her stomach growled. Her body was frail, and thin, and she was always hungry. Always devouring. Animal, human, vegetable, candy, it never made a real difference. She'd even attempted to devour herself, thousands of years ago in another body, to the horror of several onlookers.
		<br><br>
		Her many pearl bracelets and golden chains clacked against one another as she raised an arm of her current body, a restricting form with only two legs, and such tiny hands.
		When she raised her arm, an attendant left the room to collect one of her slaves. She watched him like a hawk as he left the room, before switching her attention to the young girl he returned with. The girl had been beaten, and had the bruises to show for it. Mara glared and beckoned one of her thin fingers for her attendant to come closer.
		<br><br>
		"It's damaged,"<br>
		The attendant froze up for a moment, and in that moment Mara saw an old friend stare back at her through the eyes of the man.<br>
		"Why has it been kept if it's damaged?" <br>
		Before he could make an excuse, Mara's jaw unhinged and split down the middle. The young girl watched on in horror as Mara bit the man's head off, swallowing it.
		<br><br>
		She turned and ran through the doors of Mara's office. Mara pushed the button for the intercom on her desk.<br>
		"A child has just left my office. Kill it."<br>
		Her stomach rumbled again. She idly tapped one of the many jewels she wore, but something changed. 
		She tilted her head, her pigtails flopping as she listened.
		Mara grinned widely, her skin cracking from the effort of covering her face.
		It was time.
