		<h2>Interview Log 230-1-A</h2>
		<p>
      <br>
      <i>SAI is seated at a table in the center of the interrogation room. Dr. █████ is seated across from her with a recording device and clipboard. SAI's voice is entirely monotone and her face is expressionless.</i><br>
<br>
█████: ...Is it recording? Ok.<br>
The date is the 19th of December. The time is... 4:00PM.<br>
Suspected Anomalous Individual, please state your name.<br>
SAI: destiny eath.<br>
█████: Can you spell that, as well as state pronunciation for the sake of the transcript?<br>
SAI: destiny. figure that one out. eath is spelt "E-A-T-H", pronounced "eth". rhymes with... breath.<br>
█████: Date of Birth?<br>
<br>
<i>SAI remains silent and stares blankly at Dr. █████.</i><br>
<br>
█████: ...Date of Birth, please.<br>
SAI: zero.<br>
█████: Could you elaborate?<br>
SAI: same as the universe.<br>
█████: ...I see.<br>
<br>
<i>Dr. █████ writes this down on her clipboard. SAI continues to stare blankly and without expression.</i><br>
<br>
█████: Can you explain how you were fending off Subject 230-1?<br>
SAI: with my knife.<br>
█████: I'm aware of that. I'm asking How, not what tool you used.<br>
SAI: guess.<br>
<br>
<i>Dr. █████ stares at SAI for a moment before jotting something down on her clipboard.</i><br>
<br>
█████: Billions upon billions of years of experience in Combat?<br>
SAI: ...something like that.<br>
█████: Right. Have you ever killed anything, Miss Eath?<br>
SAI: no.<br>
█████: Are you--<br>
SAI: i don't kill things. i never have killed anything. i never will kill anything.<br>
█████: I see.<br>
<br>
<i>Dr. █████ writes on her clipboard. She maintains eye contact with SAI, squinting.</i><br>
<br>
█████: ...The name is somewhat blatant, isn't it?<br>
SAI: pardon?<br>
█████: Destiny Eath? D. Eath? Really?<br>
SAI: you try looking at dead things for an eternity and see how creative you feel.<br>
█████: Right. So, for the record, am I correct in my guess?<br>
SAI: of?<br>
█████: You being the personification and/or physical embodiment of Death.<br>
SAI: wow. how did you figure it out.<br>
<br>
<i>SAI and Dr. █████ stare at each other for a second.</i><br>
<br>
SAI: that was sarcasm. sorry my voice is so monotone.<br>
█████: I see. ...What do you do, Miss Eath?<br>
SAI: i'm not a teacher. call me destiny.<br>
█████: Right. Can you answer the question?<br>
SAI: i'm a paranormal investigator.<br>
<br>
<i>Dr. █████ writes this down.</i><br>
<br>
█████: And what does that involve?<br>
SAI: tracking the consciousness of dead people who stick around.<br>
█████: How often do dead people.. "stick around"?<br>
SAI: very. how is this relevant?<br>
█████: You're here because you are a Suspected Anomalous Individual. I want to learn about you.<br>
SAI: go to a funeral.<br>
█████: ...Funny.<br>
█████: Why were you fighting Subject 230-1?<br>
SAI: i thought it was a spirit.<br>
█████: Do "spirits" usually look like that?<br>
SAI: no. each looks unique based on the wrongdoings of the person they were when alive.<br>
█████: I see. So is Subject 230-1 a Spirit, then?<br>
SAI: no.<br>
█████: No?<br>
SAI: no. i don't know what it is. it's alive, but it wasn't-<br>
<br>
<i>SAI cuts herself off.</i><br>
<br>
█████: ...Wasn't what, Destiny?<br>
<br>
<i>SAI is silent for a moment. She briefly smirks and lets out a short and quiet laugh.</i><br>
<br>
SAI: wasn't a star.<br>
█████: Can you elaborate?<br>
SAI: i can.<br>
█████: ...Will you?<br>
<br>
<i>SAI returns to a blank expression.</i><br>
<br>
SAI: no.<br>
█████: I see. ...How do Spirits form?<br>
SAI: don't know.<br>
█████: Is that true?<br>
SAI: yes. all i know about that is they only form from people who delighted in hurting others. i often use the analogy that their existence is like a bad sequel to a movie that no one asked for.<br>
█████: That's funny.<br>
SAI: is it?<br>
█████: I thought so.<br>
<br>
<i>Beat.</i><br>
<br>
█████: Are you immortal?<br>
SAI: yes.<br>
█████: Can you be hurt?<br>
SAI: no.<br>
█████: What happens if you're stabbed? Does the stabbing implement deflect off of your body?<br>
<br>
<i>SAI retrieves a dagger with a blade that curves in a squiggle from the pocket of her hoodie. She places it on the table, pulls up her right sleeve, and places her arm palm-up on the table next to the dagger.</i><br>
<br>
SAI: try.<br>
█████: Wasn't that Dagger confiscated from you when--<br>
SAI: yes. try to hurt me.<br>
<br>
<i>Beat. Dr. █████ picks up the dagger in her left hand, holding it with the blade pointed upward. She looks at SAI for a moment and raises an eyebrow before lowering the blade to SAI's wrist and slitting it. SAI shows no sign of pain, and the wound does not bleed.</i><br>
<br>
█████: No blood?<br>
<br>
<i>SAI lifts her left arm to pry open the cut on her right wrist. Inside is nothing.</i><br>
<br>
SAI: no anything. no blood, no bones, no organs, no muscles, no nerves, no veins, no cartilage. etcetera.<br>
<br>
<i>Dr. █████ seems uncomfortable, and places the dagger back on the table. She writes on her clipboard.</i><br>
<br>
█████: I see.<br>
SAI: yes.<br>
<br>
<i>Dr. █████ takes a moment to regain her composure. SAI lowers her sleeve and retracts her right arm from the table. Dr. █████ gives her a brief look of gratitude.</i><br>
<br>
█████: Ha. You'd think the physical embodiment of Death, the Grim Reaper, would at least have Bones.<br>
<br>
<i>SAI freezes up for a moment when Dr. █████ says "Grim Reaper".</i><br>
<br>
SAI: <p class=destiny>DON'T CALL ME THAT.</p><br>
<br>
<i>Beat.</i><br>
<br>
█████: Sorry. I wasn't aware it was--<br>
SAI: it's fine.<br>
█████: And you're...?<br>
SAI: yes. <br>
█████: Ah. Sorry.<br>
SAI: it's fine. don't do it again.<br>
█████: Do you want me to erase that part from the document and recording?<br>
SAI: no.<br>
█████: Right.<br>
<br>
<i>Beat.</i><br>
<br>
█████: What can you tell me?<br>
<br>
<i>SAI hesitates for a moment. She squints at Dr. █████ for a second before glancing at the recording device.</i><br>
<br>
SAI: i can tell you everything i know, if you don't document it.<br>
<br>
<i>Dr. █████ squints at SAI before shutting off the recording device. She stands, heads toward the camera, and reaches her left hand toward it.</i><br>
