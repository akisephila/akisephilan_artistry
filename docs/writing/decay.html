		<h2>Decay (Plague)</h2>
		<p>
		He straightened his tie as he left the gas station, sighing contentedly. He'd just had a very pleasant conversation with the cashier of the convenience store there, in which he'd convinced the young lady to try her hand at gambling to win the money to pay off her student debt.<br>
		He grinned when he heard an exasperated sigh from inside the store as the cashier lost at blackjack on her phone.<br>
		His true name was Decay, and while he had gone by many other names throughout his existence- Plague, Darkness, Deceit, the Abhorrent Benefactor, and the Abysmal Blight- his current one of choice was Bane Crowne.
		<br><br>
		He walked, and within a second was in an abandoned and decrepit facility. Ah, sweet memories... and bitter ones, too. This facility was the place in which for the first time ever, a mortal bested him. And given the knowledge he gained, one of his children had unknowingly bested him as well. It was over 8 years ago by this point, but it still made his smile falter even now.<br>
		He reached his hands up to his white, flame-like mane, brushing it back. His hands were fragmented and blackened, yet somehow maintained their shape despite the pieces merely floating. His legs were similar, though it was clear that at some point they'd been shaped similarly to that of a lion, or perhaps even a goat.
		<br><br>
		Reaching into his coat, he pulled out a pocket watch. It was covered in rust, and neither of the hands remained. He looked at it for a moment before putting it back inside his coat.<br>
		"Hm. Already? And I was just starting to have fun."<br>
		He glared up at the night sky for a moment, before reaching his fingers into one of the skeletal, empty eyesockets of his face and pulling out a large, fat maggot. He bit it in half, thinking for a moment before nodding.<br>
		"Very well."
		<br><br>
		He had places to be.
